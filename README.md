Old Projects
============

This repo hosts my old projects that used to be their own repositories.
Since it is *very* unlikely that the any of these projects will ever be
developed or maintained in the future, I've decided to put all of them
into one big repository for historical / archival purposes.

The List of Projects
--------------------

* **unix-rest-webservice**: oh man, this is one of those "just because
  we can" university projects. This is a shell script that implements a
  key-value storage REST webservice. It implements a small subset of
  HTTP to parse and respond to requests and uses Sqlite for storage.
  Dec 2012, developed with @ajanauskas.
* **kuro-apskaitos-sistema**: a Java GUI program that can be used to
  track cars, gas usage, trips, etc. in a company. Uses PostgreSQL for
  storage.
  Dec 2012, developed with @ajanauskas.
* **java-augalai**: another Java GUI program, OOP course project.
  Apr - May 2012, developed with @ajanauskas.
* **intel-disassembler**: x86 disassembler for DOS written in x86
  assembly. It was very intersting to write, even though it felt like
  digging a deep hole with a toothpick.
  Sep - Oct 2011.
* **unix-http-server**: a HTTP server written in C. Supports CGI, so
  you could (tehnically) run a Web 2.0 website with it. In March 2013,
  I've updated it to support AIX and not only Linux.
  Dec 2012 - Jan 2013, May 2013.
* **rope-bridge**: a simple Unity3D game.
  Dec 2013 - Jan 2014, developed with @RobertaM.
* **blowfish**: a console applicaiton that implements Blowfish encryption
  and decryption in ECB mode.

  JavaScript using Node.js and HTML5 technologies.
